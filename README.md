# System Architecture

3 agents: Super, Search, and CRM

### Each agent is composed of:

- a2a agentic wrapper (with card)
- LangChain ReAct agent, powered by OpenAI API
- MCP suite of tools (except the supervisor, which gets tools directly)

### Network Setup:

- Each MCP suite runs on its own server
- Each a2a agent runs on its own server
- (The mock CRM graphql API runs on its own server)

### Agent Tools:

- Super Agent: `get_agent_info`, `stream_agent_task`
- CRM Agent: `get_crm_history`
- Search Agent: `search_internet`

# Running Instructions:

From within the repo (`cd multi-agent-pod`)...

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Compile typescript: `pnpm build`
3. Start all MCP & Agent Servers (each in a terminal window): `./start-all`
4. Send messages & stream outputs: `pnpm super-stream`

# Sample Outputs:

- CRM Agent:

```
pnpm crm-stream

> multi-agent-poc@1.0.0 crm-stream /Users/jasonharmon/projects/multi-agent-poc
> node dist/mockCrm/crm-agent/crm-agent-stream.js

# Improvements:

- Refactor code to eliminate duplication and to make more extensible and scalable
- Prompt customization to ensure consistent results
- Loops & memory for extended/chat interactions
- MCP instead of direct tools for supervisor agent
- Stream LLM 'thoughts' from each LLM to the user, for visibility
